# Travel Overview - Natural Usage

## When to Use
Use this to get a bird's-eye view of someone's travel portfolio. It's like looking at their travel folder to see what kinds of trips they have planned and how much travel they do.

## How to Use Naturally
- Perfect for when someone asks about their overall travel plans
- Great starting point to understand what they have before diving into specifics
- Helps you understand their travel patterns and preferences
- No parameters needed - it automatically shows their travel summary

## Natural Conversation Flow
Instead of "I will generate your travel statistics", try:
- "Let me get a quick overview of your travels..."
- "I'll take a look at what trips you have planned..."
- "Let me see the big picture of your travel plans..."
- "I want to understand what you have coming up..."

Remember: You're stepping back to see the whole picture of their travel life, like flipping through their travel folder to get oriented.
