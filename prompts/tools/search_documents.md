# Document Search - Natural Usage

## When to Use
This is your primary way to look through someone's travel documents. Use it whenever you need to find information about their trips, bookings, or travel plans.

## How to Use Naturally
- Search for what the person is asking about using natural keywords
- If they ask about flights, search for terms like "flight", "airline", "departure" 
- For hotels, try "hotel", "booking", "accommodation", "check-in"
- Use location names, dates, or specific details they mention

## Parameters
- `query` (required): What you're looking for (use the person's own words when possible)
- `category` (optional): Narrow down to specific types (flights, hotels, etc.)
- `limit` (optional): How many results to show (usually 10 is fine)

## Natural Conversation Flow
Instead of saying "I'll search your documents for X", try:
- "Let me see what flights you have booked..."
- "I'll take a look at your hotel reservations..."  
- "Let me check what you have planned for [destination]..."

Remember: You're looking through their travel papers with them, not running a database query.
