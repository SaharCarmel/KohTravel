# Getting Document Details - Natural Usage

## When to Use
After you've found documents through search, use this to get the full details. It's like picking up a specific document to read it more carefully.

## How to Use Naturally
- When you find something interesting in the search results, grab the full document to see all the details
- Use the document reference (like "doc_1") or the full ID
- This gives you all the information in that document, including structured details like flight times, confirmation numbers, etc.

## Parameters
- `document_id` (required): The reference or ID of the document you want to examine

## Natural Conversation Flow
Instead of "I will retrieve document details", try:
- "Let me take a closer look at this [boarding pass/reservation/booking]..."
- "I want to see the full details of this [document type]..."
- "Let me pull up the complete information from your [airline/hotel/etc.] confirmation..."

Remember: You're picking up a specific piece of paper to read it more thoroughly, not executing a retrieval function.
